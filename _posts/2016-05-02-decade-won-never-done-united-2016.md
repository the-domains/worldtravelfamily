"If you can understand the words 'earn vacation,' you know where we're going." - Double International Marketing Director Byron Schrag

"To build your membership base, you have to have belief in the product. Which means you have to know and use the product, and understand how they add value to people's lives." - International Marketing Director Janie Braun"

"There are three levels of motivation: Material things and experiences; recognition and significance as well as purpose, calling and legacy." - International Marketing Director Matt Morris

ANNOUNCING DREAMTRIPS LOCAL

Our executives unveiled new details of the program that's going to revolutionize WorldVentures' future: DreamTrips Local (DTL). We've been testing the waters in several cities -- Dallas, Chicago, Singapore, London and Dublin -- and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

With DTL, DreamTrips Members can experience the best of their membership in their own city. They can sign up as a customer on a Monday and benefit from it on Tuesday, even if they don't plan to travel for a few months. We curate lists of the best restaurants in each city and partner with them to provide our DreamTrips Members with exclusive deals and discounts. Customers can earn DreamTrips Rewards Points by eating at participating restaurants and can dine their way to a DreamTrip.

INTRODUCING THE DREAMTRIPS MEMBERSHIP SMART CARD

Eddie and Wayne joined Chief Technology Officer Mike Remedios on stage to reveal the creation of a next generation payment solution for your customers on their travels in the form of a virtual smart card. The DreamTrips Membership Smart Card will store all of their credit cards and allow them to check in to hotels as well as earn loyalty points toward new experiences. It can be used anywhere payments can be made.

"Rather than having to carry everything, you can put it into one smart card," Mike said. "It acts as an identification card, business card and payment card. We are taking a piece of technology and giving it to you so you can enjoy your life, which allows you to live fun, freedom and fulfilment."

In the future, the DreamTrips Smart Card will also allow you to earn loyalty points toward DreamTrips. Whether you're dining out or enjoying a movie, you can use your membership at virtually any entertainment and dining location, Wayne explained.

"It's not your mom and dad's credit card," Mike stated. "It's your computer, just like your phone. It's less than half a millimetre thick, and it's got all the latest tech for communication."
